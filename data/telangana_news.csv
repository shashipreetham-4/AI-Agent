Restrictions on cotton procurement irk farmers in Telangana’s Adilabad,https://telanganatoday.com/restrictions-in-cotton-procurement-irk-farmers-in-telanganas-adilabad,"Officials refuse to buy more than 37 quintals of cotton from each farmer after 4 pm; farmers allege that they were forced to bribe computer operators at ginning mills to sell produce over the stipulated quantity  Adilabad:Farmers were irked by restrictions on sales ofcottonat procurement centres, which resumed after an 11-day hiatus caused by glitches in Aadhaar servers on Friday. The farmers, who were waiting at ginning mills to sell their cotton produce for over 10 days, were relieved when they learned that the process of procurement was resumed. They, however, expressed displeasure when the officials refused to buy more than 37 quintals of cotton from each farmer after 4 pm. Mallaiah, a farmer from Chirrakunta inAsifabadmandal, said the cap on purchasing was causing inconvenience to the farmers. He opined that it was unfair to refuse buying cotton more than 37 quintals from a grower. He said the officials were setting such restrictions for the first time. The disgruntled farmers alleged that they were forced to bribe computer operators at the mills to sell the cotton if it was more than 37 quintals. A farmer charged that he was left with no option but to offer Rs 2,000 to the operator to dispose of his 40 quintals of cotton. The farmers requested the officials to keep a vigil on the operators and marketing secretaries at the procurement centres. The haplessfarmerssaid the officials were also rejecting cotton citing higher percentage of moisture than stipulated. They lamented that they were now depending on private traders, who quote around Rs 6,500 per quintal as against theminimum support price(MSP) of Rs 7,421 per quintal fixed by the CCI. They were incurring a loss of around Rs 1,000 per quintal. Officials of the marketing department advised the farmers not to offer bribes to anyone at the time of selling their produce at the mills. Steps would be taken to ensure that the cotton was purchased till 6 pm, they said. Meanwhile, some private traders were allegedly collecting Aadhaar cards and land titles of farmers in order to sell cotton to theCCIand thus they were able to get the MSP. Seven secretaries were already suspended for issuing temporary registrations to the cotton farmers by flouting norms. © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT. LTD. All rights reserved.

Developers can begin testing the updates now.  New Delhi:Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that delivers helpful and relevant intelligence, will soon be available in more languages, including localised English for India. These new languages will be accessible in nearly all regions around the world with the release of iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 in April, and developers can start to test these releases now, Apple said in a statement. Apple Intelligence “will soon be available in more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified) — as well as localised English for Singapore and India,” said the company. With the upcoming software updates, iPhone and iPad users in the EU will have access to Apple Intelligence features for the first time, and Apple Intelligence will expand to a new platform in U.S. English with Apple Vision Pro — helping users communicate, collaborate, and express themselves in entirely new ways. Apple Intelligence marks an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI and is designed to protect users’ privacy at every step. It starts with on-device processing, meaning that many of the models that power Apple Intelligence run entirely on the device. For requests that require access to larger models, Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of iPhone into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence. Apple Intelligence will continue to expand with new features in the coming months, including more capabilities for Siri, said the company. Apple Intelligence is also coming to Apple Vision Pro in April. With Apple Intelligence for Vision Pro, users will be able to proofread, rewrite, and summarize text using Writing Tools; compose text from scratch using ChatGPT in Writing Tools; explore new ways to express themselves visually with Image Playground; create the perfect emoji for any conversation with Genmoji; and much more. Apple Intelligence will be available in beta on visionOS 2.4 with support for U.S. English. More features and support for additional languages will roll out throughout the year. Meanwhile, coming with iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 in April, Apple News+ subscribers will have access to Apple News+ Food, a new section that will feature tens of thousands of recipes — as well as stories about restaurants, healthy eating, kitchen essentials, and more — from the world’s top food publishers. © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT.

Congress government owes apology to Telangana’s farmers: KTR,https://telanganatoday.com/congress-government-owes-apology-to-telanganas-farmers-ktr,"He highlighted that the Congress government has allowed the once-flourishing Kaleshwaram project to fall into disrepair, leading to the drying up of reservoirs and a considerable decline in groundwater levels  Hyderabad:Launching a scathing attack on theCongress governmentof its gross mismanagement and negligence of the water resources leading to a severe drought conditions and groundwater depletion in the state, BRS working presidentKT Rama Raosaid that this crisis was not due to natural factors but rather the result of poor foresight and incompetence on the part of the Chief MinisterRevanth Reddyand his government. He highlighted that the Congress government has allowed the once-flourishingKaleshwaram projectto fall into disrepair, leading to the drying up of reservoirs and a considerable decline in groundwater levels. “During the ten years of the BRS government, we maintained the tanks and ponds so well that groundwater levels never dipped to such alarming levels. But within a year of the Congress government, the situation has reverted to the dire state of the past,” he stated. The plight of the farmers has been worsened by the government’s inability to address the situation, he said and criticized the administration for failing to provide any tangible solutions, instead offering empty advice to farmers not to invest in bore wells. “The government, which should be saving the dying crops, has irresponsibly washed its hands of the matter, telling farmers to fend for themselves,” he resented. Rama Rao also drew attention to the alarming rise in farmer suicides, attributing it to the Chief Minister’s lack of understanding of agricultural issues. “Already, 430 farmers have taken their own lives due to the mismanagement by a Chief Minister who has no grasp of agricultural realities,” he said. He urged the government to apologize to the farmers for the sufferings caused and to take immediate action to repair the Kaleshwaram project. He called for a war footing approach to refill the reservoirs, tanks, and canals through reverse pumping to save the withering crops. “If the Congress party and the Chief Minister fail to address this issue, the farmers of Telangana will never forgive them,” Rama Rao warned. He demanded accountability from the Congress government and immediate remedial measures to address the irrigation crisis created under its rule. He stressed the need for swift action to prevent further deterioration of the agricultural sector and to restore hope among the farmers of Telangana. © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT.

Caste survey: Revanth Reddy seeks Congress BC leaders’ support,https://telanganatoday.com/caste-survey-revanth-reddy-seeks-congress-bc-leaders-support,"Once the caste survey passes judicial scrutiny, there will be demand for such surveys in other States as well, says the Chief Minister  HYDERABAD:Alleging that the BJP and BRS were conspiring to “ruin” the entire caste survey exercise, Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy on Saturday appealed to Congress BC leaders to support him in taking the survey outcome to the people and win their confidence. “Telangana government has taken up the caste survey meticulously and officially. Unfortunately, our leaders were admitting that if there were any mistakes, they would be corrected. A few other leaders for gaining personal recognition, were stating that the figures were wrong and that the exercise should have been taken up in another way,” he said during a meeting with Congress BC leaders here on Saturday. “This was a long-pending demand and the Congress government is successfully taking it forward. You (BC leaders) might differ with me on other issues but support me in the caste survey exercise and own it up,” Revanth Reddy said. The Chief Minister said once the caste survey passes the judicial scrutiny, there would be demand for such surveys in other States as well. The Central government would be compelled to take up the survey, he said to the BC leaders. “If we forego this opportunity, it would be due to lack of political awareness. The benefits, including political, education, employment etc to be extended to sub castes would be discussed in the second phase. In the first phase, the focus was on determining the caste percentage and winning the people’s confidence,” he added.  © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT. LTD. All rights reserved.

History lives on in Hyderabad’s Bahrupiya Galli,https://telanganatoday.com/history-lives-on-in-hyderabads-bahrupiya-galli,"In the bustling neighbourhood of Puranapul, lies Bahrupiya Galli, but not many are aware of the name as they now call the area Chandrikapuram  Hyderabad:Neighbourhoods of Hyderabad, particularly the older parts of the city, have interesting tales to narrate. Several localities here draw their names from humans, animals, markets, communities and important buildings. In the bustling neighbourhood ofPuranapul, lies Bahrupiya Galli. Not many in the locality are aware of the name as they now call the place as Chandrikapuram, while some elderly know the name ‘Bahrupiya Galli’, but have no clear idea why it is called so. ‘Bahrupiya’ is a performer who impersonates characters from folklore, mythology and traditional stories. The word comes from the Sanskrit words ‘bahu’ (many) and ‘roop’ (form). In the municipal map of Puranapul — completed in 1913 after theMusi floodsunder the supervision of engineers Leonard Munn, AF Chinoy and AT Mackenzie — two lanes are marked as Bahrupiya Lane and Bahrupiya Kaccha Street. Around 200 houses were located in the lane. “In our property documents passed on to us by our forefathers, the name ‘Bahrupiya Lane’ is cited. Local residents don’t know why it is called so,” says V Kishore, a resident of the locality. During the Nizam era,Bahrupiyaor performers were recognised by the government for their skills. Many of them were great at mimicry and impersonation and would entertain in courts. Historian Karen Isaksen Leonard, in one of her writings, had mentioned: “Nizam’s Arbab-i-Nishat or Department of Entertainment included tawaifs, usually translated as courtesans or dancing and singing girls, qawwalayan (musicians), and bhands or bahrupiyas (mimics, buffoons).” They were looked after well by the administration. After the fall of theNizamgovernment, the Bahrupiya were reduced to street performers and, over a period of time, shifted to other towns and cities in the country. Local people point out that a second or third generation of the performers still live in the locality. “But they are no longer into the profession and don’t like themselves to be associated with it,” says another resident. A kilometre away from this place is Jauhari Galli atHussainialam, now popularly referred to as Koka Bazaar lane. Mohd Yousuf, an oldtimer says prominent jewellers of the city lived in the lane and hence it got the name Jauhari (jeweller). © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT. LTD. All rights reserved.

This means that applicants have the flexibility to apply at any time during the admissions cycle  Hyderabad:In the competitive world of US university admissions, understanding different application processes is crucial for prospective students. One such process that students should be aware of is that of rolling admission, which offers a different approach to applying to universities in the United States. What are‘rollingadmissions’? Rolling admissions refers to auniversity’sadmissions process where students can apply within an open period rather than a fixed deadline. The application window could begin as early as late summer or early fall in the American calendar, and may continue until theuniversity’sclasses are filled. This means that applicants have the flexibility to apply at any time during the admissions cycle, with decisions being made as their applications are reviewed. Benefits of rolling admission Flexibility intiming:One of the main benefits is the extended application window. Unlike traditional deadlines, rolling admissions provide students with several months to submit their applications, reducing stress and allowing more time for research into schools, writing personal statements, and gathering necessary documents. Fasterdecisions:Universities that use rolling admissions typically send out acceptance or rejection decisions in swift turnaroundtimelines.For students who are eager to know the outcome of their application, this quicker response can be a relief. Possibility of early non-bindingoffers:Rolling admissions permit students a chance to apply and hear from a university early within a non-binding agreement. If the university does not require an immediate response, this gives students the flexibility to wait for responses from other colleges before making a final decision. Backupoption:If a student misses a traditional deadline or does not gain admission to their top choices, rolling admission can act as a backup option. This provides a second chance to secure a spot at a reputable university. Drawbacks of rollingadmissions Despite the flexibility offered by rolling admissions, some potential drawbacks must beconsidered: Limitedspots:As seats are filled throughout the admission period, late applicants may find that their options are limited. This is particularly true for highly popular programmes, where spaces are filled early in the process. Missedscholarships:Many universities have priority deadlines for scholarships and financial aid. Applying later in the cycle may mean missing out on these opportunities, which could affect thestudent’sfinancial planning. Pressure to applyearly:The lack of a strict deadline can create a sense of urgency to apply as early as possible. Decision-makingpressure:While rolling admission gives students more time, it may also create pressure to make decisions quickly. Once a student receives an acceptance offer, they may have to commit before hearing from other schools, making it harder to compare options thoroughly. Non-availability for popularprogrammes:Universities that offer selective admissions to highly competitive programmes may not offer rolling admissions to international students. Key considerations Applicationtiming:Although the rolling admission process remains open for several months, the availability of spots diminishes as the cycle progresses. As universities fill their incoming classes, competition becomes intense. Therefore, applying as early as possible can increase your chances of being admitted, especially to highly competitive programmes. Financial aid andscholarships:Early applicants often have access to better financial aid options, as some universities allocate funding on a first-come, first-served basis. Waiting until later in the cycle may result in fewer scholarship opportunities or limited aid packages. Quality ofapplication:With rolling admissions, it is critical to submit a well-prepared application. Rushing to submit early can, sometimes, result in an under-prepared application, which could reduce the chances of acceptance. —U.S.Consulate General Hyderabad Please visit the U.S.-India EducationalFoundation’swebsiteto learn more about studying in the UnitedStates:https://www.usief.org.in/Hyderabad.aspx Phone/WhatsApp:91-8008465712/8008462560.Email:usiefhyderabad@usief.org.in|hyderabad@educationusa.org © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT.

Roll calls to end in Telangana government junior colleges; attendance to be recorded this way,https://telanganatoday.com/roll-calls-to-end-in-telangana-government-junior-colleges-attendance-to-be-recorded-this-way,"The Intermediate Education Department decided to introduce facial recognition system in all 424 government junior colleges to tackle absenteeism  Hyderabad:In a move to tackle absenteeism in the government junior colleges (GJCs), the Intermediate Education Department decided to introduce afacial recognition system(FRS) for recording attendance of students from the next academic year. This new system, which ends roll calls and marking attendance in registers, is aimed at monitoringstudents’attendance more effectively. Apart from monitoringstudents’turn up on a daily basis, parents will be informed about their wards absence from the college.“Ifa student is absent for four to five consecutive days, the college concerned will inform the parents. The new system is aimed at increasing attendance percentage in the colleges,” said S Krishna Aditya, Director of Intermediate Education. The move by the department comes following a large absenteeism in thecolleges. There are 424GJCsin the State with a total of 2,88,310 seats, including 1,44,460 in first year and 1,43,850 in second year. However, only 1.6lakhstudents enrolled with 80,000 in first year and 78,000 in second year this academic year. Attendance in these colleges has become a cause for concern for officials as, on average, 40 per cent of students are found not attending classes. This has been revealed during recent inspections conducted by officials deputed by the department. As perofficials’observation,students’attendance was low in several colleges inKamareddy,Adilabad,Asifabad,Sircilla, andKarimnagardistricts. To begin with, the new system will be introduced for the government junior lecturers, doing away with the present practice of recording attendance via abiometric system. It will be extended to students as well. For this, the FRS devices will be installed in all theGJCsbefore the commencement of the fresh academic year.“AFRS device will be installed in the colleges based on the enrolment, and, shortly, tenders will be called viaTelanganaTechnology Servicesfor procuring and installation of the devices,” a senior official said. Further, the department set a target of increasing admissions by 60 per cent over and above the presentenrolment.For this, theGJCshave been asked to undertake an admission drive by visiting feeder government schools in theGJCregion. The officials have been asked to inform parents and students about the facilities being provided in the colleges, qualified lecturers and free education, along with textbooks. © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT.

Editorial: Uphill task for Delhi CM Rekha Gupta,https://telanganatoday.com/editorial-uphill-task-for-delhi-cm-rekha-gupta,"As Rekha Gupta gets down to the nitty-gritty of administrative business, she is up against many challenges — from fulfilling election promises to cleaning the Yamuna  By appointing first-time legislator Rekha Gupta as Delhi Chief Minister, the BJP may have justifiably claimed to have walked the talk on honouring ‘Nari Shakti’ but the real challenges of governing the national capital lie ahead.Gupta, the fourth woman Chief Minister of Delhi, happens to be the only incumbent woman CM in any BJP-ruled State. Gender and community factors played a key role in the saffron party’s choice for the coveted post. Nurtured in the student politics of Delhi University and rose through the ranks in the organisation, Gupta now has her hands full. As she gets down to the nitty-gritty of administrative business, she is up against many challenges — from managing the finances and fulfilling its main election promises to cleaning the Yamuna and improving civic conditions. Gupta’s appointment was announced 11 days after the party’s landslide victory in the Assembly elections, ending the AAP’s 10-year regime. The other contenders included Parvesh Verma, the ‘giant killer’ who defeated AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal in the New Delhi seat; DelhiBJPgeneral secretary Ashish Sood, former Leader of Opposition Vijender Gupta and Malviya Nagar MLA Satish Upadhyay. During the campaign, the BJP, in a bid to outsmart the AAP, had focused on wooing women voters, with the party’s manifesto promising Rs 2,500 monthly aid for women, Rs 21,000 for pregnant women and pensions for seniors. For Gupta (50), whose campaign website’s tagline is “Kaam hi Pehchaan” (my work is my identity), the implementation of the party’s poll promises will prove to be an acid test. There are high public expectations from the new government on a host of issues ranging from improving the condition of roads and ensuring drinking water supply to the construction of houses for the poor and regularisation of illegal colonies. The new government needs to get cracking to put together the budget for the new fiscal, keeping in mind allocations for the scheme for women as well as Rs 21,000 for pregnant women, as promised. The immediate implementation of theAyushman Bharatscheme is also on top of the BJP’s agenda. The previousAAPregime did not adopt it, becoming the only administration after the Trinamool Congress-led West Bengal government to reject the Centre’s health insurance scheme. Cleaning Yamuna River is another big promise waiting to be implemented. The high pollution level in the river was a major talking point during the poll campaign, with the BJP promising to do what neither theCongressnor the AAP could achieve during their time in power. The ambitious plan, launched on February 16, 2025, aims to restore the polluted river within three years through a four-pronged strategy focusing on waste removal, drain cleaning, and sewage treatment plant upgrades and construction. With Prime Minister Narendra Modi according it a top priority, the BJP’s success hinges on effectively executing the complex project.  © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT. LTD.

"Editorial: Unmaking friends, befriending foes",https://telanganatoday.com/editorial-unmaking-friends-befriending-foes,"By projecting Ukraine as a villain in the ongoing conflict, US President Trump is playing a dangerous game that could further alienate America’s traditional allies, including Europe  Trump 2.0 appears to be bent upon harming friends more than the foes. He has been picking America’s allies for some harsh treatment while befriending rivals — usually the infamous dictators — in his ambitious pursuit of reshaping the global order.Trump’s statements on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war — blaming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for ‘starting the war’ and dubbing him as a ‘dictator without elections’ — are outrageous and reflect his warped sense of history. By projecting Ukraine, not as a victim of invasion but as a villain in the ongoing conflict, the US President is not only spreading a deliberate lie but also playing a dangerous game that could further alienate America’s traditional allies, including Europe. Shielding Russian President VladimirPutin,who ordered a military invasion of the tiny neighbour, and laying the blame at the doorstep of Zelenskyy amounts to a blatant distortion of reality. Though Trump has never been a fan of Ukraine and has long expressed admiration for Putin, his latest vitriol targeted atZelenskyysent shock waves across European nations which, along with the US, have been extending financial and military help to Ukraine to take on the mighty Russia. Trump has dubbed Zelenskyy as “a modestly successful comedian who talked the US into spending $350 billion to go into a war that could not be won”. Both his claims are far from the truth: Neither the US spent so much money nor did Ukraine start the war. Trump has never been particularly sympathetic to Ukraine even before the latest conflict. As far back as his first campaign for President in 2016, he signalled that he could accept Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and expressed admiration for Putin’s strength. Later, in 2019, he directly approached Ukrainian leadership to help tarnish the image of JoeBiden, then the leading Democratic candidate for President, by announcing a corruption investigation. Trump even withheld military aid to Ukraine at the same time and only released it under pressure from advisers and Republican senators. Revelations about his actions during the time led to his impeachment by the House later that year. Curiously, Ukraine has been left out of the ongoing high-level talks between theUnited Statesand Russia in Riyadh, ostensibly aimed at ending the Russia-Ukraine war. Though American authorities have assured that Kyiv and Europe will be part of the negotiation process moving forward, the key question is whether the talks will lead to a just resolution that respects Ukraine’s sovereignty. With Washington andMoscowfocusing on territorial discussions and long-term security arrangements, Ukraine will need to ensure that its core interests are not compromised. The challenge is to balance diplomatic flexibility with firm red lines, ensuring that any settlement strengthens Ukraine’s sovereignty and independence. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether these negotiations can lead to a lasting solution. © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT. LTD. All rights reserved.

Editorial: Errors of Comedy,https://telanganatoday.com/editorial-errors-of-comedy,"Criminalising offensive jokes and filing FIRs for unleashing the full police force on the accused are not the solution  Like all other professions, India’s comedy scene too has its share of flaws. Quite often,body-shaming, cherry-picking certain demographics for mocking and putting up an air of condescending and self-righteousness are passed off as comedy. Compared to its Western counterparts, Indian stand-up comedy is still in its infancy in terms of the range of subjects and the depth of content. It’s a profession that is struggling to shake up a rather rigid and patriarchal value system with strict moral guardrails. No wonder that a popular podcaster and entrepreneur Ranveer Allahbadia’s impulsive and crass comment on a YouTube show, ‘India’s Got Latent’, triggered nationwide outrage, prompting multipleFIRsbeing registered across a few States and the matter reaching theSupreme Court. There should be no two opinions about the fact that Allahbadia’s comment on parental sex was cheap, vulgar and represented gutter-level humour. However, criminalising offensive jokes, and filing FIRs for unleashing the full police force on the accused are not the solution. Allahbadia, better known as ‘BeerBicep’, has tendered unconditional public apology while the show’s host, Samay Raina, a popular comedian, has deleted all the videos of the show. The matter should rest here. It is a matter of individual conscience, not state enforcement. Faced with a dilemma between moral indignation and constitutional propriety, the apex court did some tightrope walking. While granting the podcaster interim protection from arrest over his outrageous comments, the court did not hold back on its criticism, asking, “If this is not obscenity, what is?” Justice Surya Kantminced no words, calling Allahbadia’s comments “shameful” and reflective of a “perverted mind”. At the same time, the highest court of the land offered protection to Allahbadia’s personal liberty, though the hearing in the case was dominated by moral outrage. When the clip of the show’s teaser went viral, the police and the National Women’s Commission (NWC) summoned the podcaster and the show’s creator. It also triggered a massive backlash onsocial mediawith many angry users attacking the creators of the show for demeaning Indian values. An outcry frommediahouses and politicians has only added fuel to the fire. The podcaster also received death threats from enraged followers. However, the legal question is not whether Allahbadia’s language was distasteful — everyone, including his own lawyer, admitted that it was vulgar— but whether it amounted to a criminal offence under Indian law. It must be pointed out that the primary duty of the judiciary is to uphold constitutional rights, including free speech and personal liberty. The courts are not custodians of morality. The constitutional protection for free speech is invoked only in cases where unpleasant and unpopular speech gets prosecuted. Amid the raging controversy, an eyewitness who was among the audience of the show took to Instagram, revealing that soon after the show Allahbadia profusely apologised to the contestant multiple times. © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT.

Editorial: Irrepressible Sam Pitroda,https://telanganatoday.com/editorial-irrepressible-sam-pitroda,"Pitroda’s goof-ups, happening with unfailing regularity, will cause considerable damage to the Congress  Sam Pitroda, credited with laying the foundation for India’s telecommunication revolution, is no stranger to controversies. His ‘foot in the mouth’ proclivity has often landed the Congress in trouble. As chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress, hispublic commentson various issues are often found at variance with the party’s official stand. His latest remark that India should stop viewing China as an enemy has ignited a firestorm in political circles, forcing the Congress to go on the back foot and swiftly dissociate itself from the controversial observation. In a media interview, Pitroda sought to give a curious spin to Asian geopolitics when he said that the threat from China was always exaggerated and that such a perception was due to the tendency of the United States to “define an enemy”. For an already demoralised Congress leadership, in the wake of one electoral defeat after another, his remarks will no doubt cause acute embarrassment. It was preposterous on the part of the Congress leader to suggest that India’s “attitude has been of confrontation from day one” and that the country should “change that pattern.” Such irresponsible formulations betray ignorance of history and a total lack of understanding about the recent bilateral tensions. One wonders whether Pitroda is not aware of the anguish that every Indian citizen feels over the Chinese aggression in the Galwan Valley and the supreme sacrifices of Indian soldiers. Such observations amount to insulting the martyrdom of our soldiers. Further, he also wanted Indians to ‘recognise and respect the fact that China is growing’. Though theCongressdistanced itself from the controversy saying Pitroda’s remarks did not reflect the official position, such goof-ups by a senior functionary, happening with unfailing regularity, would cause considerable damage to the party. Pitroda, a closeaideof the Nehru-Gandhi family, has often made statements that sent theCongressscurrying for cover. In the run-up to the 2024 general elections, he landed the Congress in a spot after his remarks on India’s diversity and the need for a debate on inheritance tax went viral. He had then mooted the idea of taxing the inherited wealth, triggering a massive political furore. It only added fuel to the fire on the controversial Congress’ promise of redistribution of wealth in the country. On another occasion, while speaking about the diversity of India, he triggered anothercontroversyby referring to how people in the South “look like Africans and those in the East look like Chinese and those in the West look like Arab”. This prompted theBJPto dub him as racist. In June 2023, ahead of the anticipated grand opening of the Ram temple at Ayodhya, Pitroda sparked controversy by asserting that temples would not address India’s pressing issues such as unemployment, inflation, education and health. His remarks provided the saffron party with ammunition to attack the Congress. © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT. LTD. All rights reserved.

CT 2025: Australia beat England in highest successful chase ever in ICC event,https://telanganatoday.com/ct-2025-inglis-ton-helps-australia-beat-england-in-highest-successful-chase-ever-in-icc-event,"Record highest successful chase ever in any ICC 50-overs event; Inglis remains not out on 120 off just 86 balls from which he hit eight fours and six sixes as Australia chased down 352 with 15 balls to spare  Lahore:Australia rode on Josh Inglis’ unbeaten century to beat England by five wickets to record the highest successful chase ever in any ICC 50-overs event, during their Champions Trophy match here on Saturday. Inglis remained not out on 120 off just 86 balls from which he hit eight fours and six sixes as Australia chased down the target of 352 with 15 balls to spare. Opener Matthew Short and Alex Carey contributed 63 and 69 respectively while Marnus Labuschagne made 47 as Australia reached 356 for 5 in 47.3 overs. Earlier, a magnificent 165 from opening batter Ben Duckett powered England to 351 for 8. Duckett’s 143-ball commanding innings was studded with 17 fours and three sixes, while Joe Root contributed 68 after England were asked to bat first. For Australia, Ben Dwarshuis took three wickets for 66 runs while Adam Zampa and Marnus Labuschagne chipped in with two each. Earlier, Ben Duckett struck a magnificent career-best 165 to power England to 351 for 8 against Australia in their Champions Trophy Group B opening match here on Saturday. England, after being sent in to bat, were in early trouble at 43/2 inside the powerplay, but Duckett stood tall, first stitching a 158-run stand with Joe Root (68) and later forging a crucial 61-run partnership with skipper Jos Buttler (23 off 21 balls). After his dismissal in the 48th over, Jofra Archer smashed two fours and one six in his 10-ball 21 not-out to prop up the total past the 350 mark. Duckett’s innings was meticulously planned, blending patience with aggression. He started confidently, taking on Glenn Maxwell with a charge-down six in just the second over, setting the tone for England’s recovery. Once settled, he rotated strike fluently with Root, allowing the innings to flow, before shifting gears in the latter half. Duckett brought up his century off 95 balls with back-to-back boundaries off Spencer Johnson, marking his second ODI ton against Australia. The depleted Australian side struggled as their frontline spinner Adam Zampa was hit by Duckett all around the park. © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT. LTD. All rights reserved.

Manu Bhaker to lead 35-member team for ISSF World Cups,https://telanganatoday.com/manu-bhaker-to-lead-35-member-team-for-issf-world-cups,"Baker will be accompanied by other Paris Olympians like Anish Bhanwala, Vijayveer Sidhu among others  New Delhi:Ace pistol shooter Manu Bhaker will lead a 35-member Indian team in the season-opening ISSF World Cups in April in South America with almost all the shooters who featured in the Paris Olympics making the cut. A notable member of the team is air pistol ace Saurabh Chaudhary, who returns to the national side after more than three years. Saurabh, who battled a shoulder injury and poor form following the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, recently shot a national record score in 10m air pistol qualification besides impressing in the trials. He had paired with Manu in the 10m air pistol mixed team event in Tokyo. The international shooting season will begin with a double-leg South American sojourn, with the first World Cup (Rifle/Pistol/Shotgun) scheduled in Buenos Aires, Argentina from April 1-11, which will be followed by a second combined World Cup in Lima, Peru from April 13-22. Manu, who was recently awarded the Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna award for her two bronze medals at the Paris Olympics in 10m women’s air pistol and 10m air pistol mixed team event with Sarabjot Singh, will compete in the South American competitions in two individual events — women’s air pistol and 25m pistol. She will be accompanied by other Paris Olympians like Anish Bhanwala and Vijayveer Sidhu (men’s 25m rapid-fire pistol), Esha Singh (women’s 25m pistol), Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar (men’s 50m rifle 3 positions), Sift Kaur Samra and Shriyanka Sadangi (women’s 50m rifle 3 positions), Arjun Babuta (men’s 10m air rifle), Prithviraj Tondaiman (men’s trap), Anant Jeet Singh Naruka (men’s skeet) and Raiza Dhillon (women’s skeet). Ahead of the team’s departure, the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) will organise a training camp at the Karni Singh Range here from March 14.The biggest draw on the ISSF calendar this year will be the World Championships scheduled in October (shotgun) and November (rifle/pistol). “There will be a total of three World Cup stages for each discipline while two junior World Cups, the second among them in New Delhi in September, are also scheduled. Also on the international roster this year is the 16th Asian Championships in Kazakhstan in August,” said NRAI in a statement. NRAI secretary-general Sultan Singh said it was time for the Indian shooters to raise the bar further following their success at the Paris Olympics, where the 21-member contingent bagged three bronze medals. “A new responsibility rests on the entire shooting fraternity to raise the bar even higher. We are confident that those selected for the international season openers will come out with flying colours,” said Singh. NRAI recently announced a long list of coaches and experts to guide the Indian shooters on their journey to the 2028 LA Games with Manu’s coach Jaspal Rana heading the chart. Rana was brought back into the Indian shooting’s mainstream with the NRAI making him the high-performance coach for 25m pistol, while picking the decorated Jitu Rai for the 10m air pistol coaching job. Also appointed as head coach (rifle) was the latest Dronacharya award recipient Deepali Deshpande, who guided rifle shooter Swapnil Kusale to bronze in Paris. © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT.

"No breakfast, no lunch, I eat only one meal a day—dinner: Shami",https://telanganatoday.com/no-breakfast-no-lunch-i-eat-only-one-meal-a-day-dinner-shami,"Shami gives an insight into how he keeps match-fit even at the age of 34  Dubai:Giving an insight into how he keeps match-fit even at the age of 34, Indian bowling stalwart Mohammed Shami says he prefers to eat only one meal a day and has never had a craving for delicacies. “After 2015, I only have one meal a day. I only have dinner; no breakfast, no lunch. It is very difficult to do such a thing but once you get used to it then it becomes very easy,” said Shami in an interaction with cricketer-turned-commentator Navjot Singh Sidhu on Star Sports. Shami has been the standout bowler for India in the ongoing Champions Trophy with the pace spearhead grabbing five wickets against Bangladesh in the marquee event in Dubai, thus becoming the fastest Indian bowler to take 200 ODI wickets. He had been sidelined from international cricket for 14 months due to an ankle injury sustained during the 2023 ODI World Cup final against Australia, which interrupted a remarkable run where he topped the tournament’s wicket-taker’s chart with 24 scalps. The injury required surgery, and his recovery was further delayed by swelling on his left knee, keeping him out of international action for more than a year. Shami said he gained quite a bit of weight during the recovery phase. “I have lost nine kgs (during rehabilitation). The most difficult thing is you have to challenge yourself. When you are in this condition… when I was at the NCA, it was a very difficult phase.”“My weight was touching 90kgs. The best thing about me is that I do not crave for delicacies. I stay away from sweets. I stay away from a lot of things, things that generally one shouldn’t eat. So, I stay away from them,” said Shami, who will have to shoulder a lot of responsibility in India’s clash against arch-rivals Pakistan in the Champions Trophy here on Sunday. © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT.

Dispirited Pak stands no chance against confident India: Kaneria,https://telanganatoday.com/dispirited-pak-stands-no-chance-against-confident-india-kaneria,"Danish Kaneria says India playing with regained confidence after their victory against England in the recent white-ball series at home  New Delhi:Former Pakistan spinner Danish Kaneria opined that the Mohammad Rizwan-led side has no chance of winning against India in their Champions Trophy spectacle at Dubai International Stadium on Sunday. Kaneria backed his statement by highlighting Pakistan’s dismal run in the recent series including the loss in the Tri-Nation Series and 1-1 draw against West Indies in the Test series on home soil. On the other hand, the veteran spinner cited India’s example of how they crushed England in the white-ball series after the debacle in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia. “After the debacle in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, India defeated England in the white-ball series at home. They got their confidence back as Rohit, Virat scored runs while Shami also returned to the team and silenced critics with his bowling and bags fifer against Bangladesh,” Kaneria told IANS. He added that India’s spinners will pose difficulty to Babar Azam due to the presence of left-arm bowlers – Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel. “India have better spinners and Babar Azam struggles against left-arm spinners. How will he tackle Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel. On the other hand, Pakistan don’t have a good spinner and we’ve seen Virat and other batters struggle against the leg-spinner. The match is very big but Pakistan don’t have any chance of winning the match on February 23,” Kaneria remarked. The former cricketer also blamed Babar for not showing intent against New Zealand in the tournament opener after he scored 90-ball 64 while chasing 321. Kaneria lauded Khushdil Shah for showing intent during his 49-ball 69 laced with 10 fours and a six. © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT. LTD. All rights reserved.

"‘Made in India’ iPhone 16e not SE variant, say experts",https://telanganatoday.com/made-in-india-iphone-16e-not-se-variant-say-experts,"The new Apple device equipped with A18 chip, Apple Intelligence and a 48MP 2-in-1 camera system, being manufactured/assembled for local consumption, export  New Delhi:In a further push to local manufacturing, the entire iPhone 16 lineup, including the newly-launched iPhone 16e, is now being assembled in India for domestic market as well as for exports, as industry experts on Thursday cleared the air around the new device being compared to now-retired iPhone SE. The new Apple device, with A18 chip, breakthrough battery life, Apple Intelligence, and a 48MP 2-in-1 camera system, is being manufactured/assembled for local consumption as well as for export to select countries. According to experts, iPhone 16e is not iPhone SE4 and the whole “comparison is futile”. When iPhone SE was launched, it was another masterstroke at that time. However, times have changed since then. “Essentially, Apple retired the SE lineup and extended the iPhone 16 lineup with a new entry point. iPhone SE was no longer adding any value to consumers, developers or Apple,” said Neil Shah, Partner and Co-Founder at Counterpoint Research. The iPhone SE which was positioned as a ‘Special Edition’, which brought nostalgia of older and smaller design, was priced around $400. However, the iPhone SE lost its value and popularity, which used to be once 16 per cent of the total iPhone sales volumes, dropped to 1 per cent last year. According to Shah, consumers now prefer better cameras, bigger displays and faster processors. “With all this background, what Apple did was to extend the 16 series with a newer ‘base version’ of iPhone 16 and now retired SE,” Shah explained. According to industry experts, the company has done well with streamlining the series, reducing fragmentation in design and experience and able to charge $599 (US)/Rs 59,999 (India) with the newest entry point for the best Apple experiences.   © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT.

The iPhone 16e unveiled on Wednesday is the fourth-generation of a model that’s sold at a dramatically lower price than theiPhone’s standard and premium models. The previous bargain-bin models were called the iPhone SE, with the last version coming out in 2022. Like the higher-priced iPhone 16 lineup unveiled last September, the iPhone 16e includes the souped-up computer chip needed to process an array of AI features that automatically summarise text, audio and create on-the-fly emojis while smartening up the device’s virtual assistant,Siri. It will also have a more powerful battery and camera. All those upgrades will translate into a higher starting price for an iPhone 16e at $600 (Rs 59,900), a 40 per cent increase from $430 for the last iPhone SE. But iPhone 16e will be more affordable than the cheapest standard iPhone 16 at $800. The device will be available in white and black in 128GB, 256GB and 512GB storage capacities, said the company.  The new phone will be available in stores from February 28, but can be pre-ordered beginning Friday. “We’re so excited for iPhone 16e to complete the lineup as a powerful, more affordable option to bring the iPhone experience to even more people,” said Kaiann Drance, an Apple vice-president in charge of promoting a device lineup that accounts for more than half of the company’s revenue. Although Apple has been hyping its foray into AI since last June, the complete set of features still haven’t been released in the US and the technology still isn’t even available in some parts of the world. The delays in making the iPhone’s AI — dubbed ‘Apple Intelligence’ — more widely available through free software updates dinged the Cupertino, California, company during the past holiday when sales of the device dipped slightly from their 2023 levels. Apple has primarily been losing the ground in China, where it hasn’t yet specified when the iPhone’s AI technology will be available. But the company recently struck an AI partnership with Alibaba in China that could pave the way for the technology coming to iPhones in that country this spring. Besides being able to handle AI for the first time, the iPhone 16e has a different look from previous SE models. It boasts a 6.1-inch display screen, slightly larger than the 4.7-inch display on SE model and no longer has a home screen button like the SE had. The new iPhone 16e will rely include a facial recognition option for unlocking the device, just like the higher priced models do.Apple’s shares edged up during Wednesday’s late morning trading to nearly $245, below the stock’s peak price of roughly $260 reached in late December. © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT.

The day when PlayStations stood still,https://telanganatoday.com/the-day-when-playstations-stood-still,"PlayStations, Video Game, Gadgets, Gadget news, Video games news, PS5, Hyderabad, Bangalore  What can we learn from the nearly all-day server outage of February 8? On Saturday, February 8th, 2025, I woke up as usual at 5.45 am, ready to make myself some hot chocolate, and log into my PS5 to check my progress in my latest game. Like most digital games today, it was an online game, but as it attempted to log me in, the PS5 simply wouldn’t let me. Every attempt resulted in me being thrown out, and the error dialog suggested that I wasn’t connected to the internet. Running my usual internet diagnostics, I quickly realized that everything from WhatsApp to Netflix was running perfectly. The only issues were with the PS5 and Sony. Like most gamers in need of their Saturday gaming fix, I then tried launching a few single-player games (Dragon Age Inquisition, Kingdom Come Deliverance II), only to find that the PS5 servers weren’t able to run the customary checks to start them. Soon after, the console wouldn’t even let me log into my profile, and things seemed to be getting worse by the minute. The issue wasn’t limited to a single location or server, it was global. Friends in Hyderabad, Bangalore, the US, and even Canada were facing similar issues. The only ones who managed to keep playing were those who had left their console in “rest mode” and resumed play instead of starting a new session. However, one of them spent six hours in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, to find that their progress had failed to sync with the servers. I’m sure you’ll find countless versions of these challenges faced by gamers on the day Sony’s PSN collapsed, an outage the Japanese giant attributed to “operational issues” without offering any further details. But in an era where global outages can be truly disruptive (as seen with Microsoft’s crash last summer), it’s worth asking: what’s the plan B in such situations? Platforms like Sony and Xbox use internet connections to periodically verify the authenticity of a player’s game copy (an anti-piracy measure reminiscent of Denuvo DRM) while also providing features like cloud saves and cross-device play. Add to this the conveniences like remote play, and a constant reliance on the internet seems like a “no-brainer.” However, it’s only when you lose access that you realize what you’ve taken for granted. Sony and the larger gaming industry’s lack of preparedness for challenges like this continue to be exposed. As the industry pushes toward a future where games are accessed like streaming libraries, it becomes imperative to ask: how robust are our systems? Is there a backup network of servers and infrastructure that PSN could automatically switch to in the event of an outage? If not, could PS5s and other consoles retain enough information from a player’s last session to allow uninterrupted play until PSN is restored? Can Sony find a way to rely not just on the cloud but also on locally saved data? I am sure better minds than mine are at work to find solutions to the outage from the 8th of February. But at the end of the day, players who are, after all, paying subscribers, deserve transparency about what steps are being taken to ensure that services remain uninterrupted in the future. Sony’s measure of five days of free PS Plus access to existing subscribers as compensation is neither sufficient nor a move in the right direction. Access was also restricted for players who just rely on their consoles for single player games and Sony’s response completely overlooks them. © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT. LTD.

Microsoft ‘s new free tool OmniParser V2 gives more power to large language models (LLMs),https://telanganatoday.com/microsoft-s-new-free-tool-omniparser-v2-gives-more-power-to-large-language-models-llms,"OmniParser V2 is trained with a larger set of interactive element detection data and icon functional caption data. By decreasing the image size of the icon caption model, OmniParser V2 reduces the latency by 60% compared to the previous version  Hyderabad:A new AI model, OmniParser V2, was unveiled by Microsoft. The open-source model allows large language models (LLMs) — which are deep-learning models pre-trained on vast amounts of data — to act as agents capable of using a computer. According toMicrosoft, Graphic User interface (GUI) automation requires agents with the ability to understand and interact with user screens. However, using general purpose LLMmodels to serve as GUI agents faces several challenges: 1) reliably identifying interactable icons within the user interface, and 2) understanding the semantics of various elements in a screenshot and accurately associating the intended action with the corresponding region on the screen. OmniParser closes this gap by ‘tokenising’ UI screenshots from pixel spaces into structured elements in the screenshot that are interpretable by LLMs. This enables the LLMs to do retrieval based next action prediction given a set of parsed interactable elements. OmniParser V2 takes this capability to the next level. Compared to its predecessor, it achieves higher accuracy in detecting smaller interactable elements and faster inference, making it a useful tool for GUI automation. In particular, OmniParser V2 is trained with a larger set of interactive element detection data and icon functional caption data. By decreasing the image size of the icon caption model, OmniParser V2 reduces the latency by 60% compared to the previous version. Notably, Omniparser+GPT-4o achieves state-of-the-art average accuracy of 39.6 on a recently released grounding benchmark ScreenSpot Pro, which features high resolution screen and tiny target icons. This is a substantial improvement on GPT-4o’s original score of 0.8. In simple terms, OmniParserV2 is a tool designed to help AI models interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), like the ones you see on your computer screen. When AI models are asked to automate tasks in a GUI, they face two main problems:1. Recognising which parts of the screen can be interacted with (like buttons, icons, etc.).2. Understanding what each part of the screen means and knowing what action should be taken on it (like clicking a button or entering text). OmniParser V2 solves these problems by taking a screenshot of the GUI and breaking it down into structured, understandable elements. It converts the visual information (the pixels) into parts that AI models can easily interpret. This makes it possible for AI to predict what the next action should be based on the parsed elements, such as which button to press or field to fill in.

"Who is Kash Patel, the first Indian American FBI Director?",https://telanganatoday.com/who-is-kash-patel-the-first-indian-american-fbi-director,"Kash Patel took over as the ninth director of the FBI, succeeding Christopher Wray for a stated tenure of 10 years. Patel was part of Trump’s entourage during the US President’s visit to India in 2020  Hyderabad:The United States President Donald Trump’s loyalist Kash Patel became the first Indian American Director of the FBI. The Senate narrowly voted (51-49) to place him atop the nation’s premier federal law enforcement agency. Patel’s nomination was among the most controversial by Trump in his second term, along with Tulsi Gabbard, for director of national intelligence, and Robert F Kennedy Jr, for heading health and human services. Who is Kash Patel? Born on February 25, 1980, Kashyap Pramod Vinod Patel popularly known as Kash Patel, was born in New York to Gujarati Hindu immigrant parents. His parents first moved to Canada in 1970s from Uganda and subsequently to the United States. He is a lawyer by profession, a former federal prosecutor and official, and a  conspiracy theorist. He served as a National Security Council official, chief of staff to the acting US Secretary of Defence and senior advisor to the acting director of national intelligence during the first term of Donald Trump as the US President. Among his many roles, Patel played a key part in helping Republicans in the investigations into Trump and Russian interference into 2016 elections. He was instrumental in drafting the Nunes Memo in 2018, which alleged falsification in the FBI application for a surveillance warrant of a Trump 2016 campaign aide. During that time, he became ‘hero’ among Trump’s allies. It was alleged that Patel acted as a back channel for Trump on Ukraine policy. Kash Patel was part of Trump’s entourage during the latter’s visit to India in 2020 and was reported as one of the two Indian Americans by the media. Patel had promoted several conspiracy theories on his podcasts and sold branded merchandise under the logotype ‘K$H.’ He is president and a board member of the Kash Foundation based in Virginia. He also owns a firm Trishul, which provided national security, defense, and intelligence consulting for Qatar. He had no plans to divest himself Trishul, but had said that Trishul will remain dormant if he was appointed as Director of the FBI. Is Patel a favourite? Democrats have doubts about his qualifications and concerns he will do Donald Trump’s bidding and go after the President’s adversaries. Patel has spoken of his desire to implement major changes at the FBI, including a reduced footprint at headquarters in Washington and a renewed emphasis on the bureau’s traditional crime-fighting duties rather than the intelligence-gathering and national security work that has come to define its mandate over the past two decades. Kash Patel raised alarm among Democrats for saying before he was nominated that he would “come after” anti-Trump “conspirators” in the federal government and the media. Republicans angry over what they see as law enforcement bias against conservatives during the Democratic Biden administration, as well as criminal investigations into Trump, have rallied behind Patel as the right person for the job. Democrats complained about Patel’s lack of management experience compared with previous FBI Directors and they highlighted incendiary past statements that they said called his judgment into question. About a half-dozen Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee gathered outside FBI headquarters in a last-ditch plea to derail his confirmation. Two Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins voted with all Democrats against confirming Trump’s nominee. Patel’s eyebrow-raising remarks on hundreds of podcasts and in other interviews over the past four years include referring to law enforcement officials who investigated Trump as “criminal gangsters,” saying some January 6 rioters were “political prisoners” and proposing to shut down the FBI headquarters and turning it into a museum for the so-called deep state. Kash Patel’s predecessors Patel took over as the ninth director of the agency, succeeding Christopher Wray for a stated tenure of 10 years, which, however, ended prematurely for both his immediate predecessors. Wray resigned on Trump’s election two years short of his term and James Comey had barely completed four of his 10-year term after President Donald Trump fired him in 2017. The first Indian American FBI Director will also be the first of Asian descent. © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT. LTD. All rights reserved.

A YouTuber in India is facing backlash over comments made on comedy show. Here’s what to know,https://telanganatoday.com/youtuber-india-facing-backlash-over-comments-made-comedy-show-heres-what-know,"Many content creators, journalists and digital experts say it could lead to censorship, stifle free speech and significantly expand the government’s powers to regulate digital media content  NewDelhi:A famousYouTuberin India is facing public outrage and a police investigation after he made an allegedly obscene remark on aYouTubeshow, raising questions aboutfreedom of speechin a country where digital creators in the past have come under fire for their content. The controversy began last week whensocial mediainfluencerandYouTuberRanveerAllahbadiamade remarks to a participant on a comedy show about hisparents’personal relationship. The joke was quickly condemned by social media users, public figures and political leaders. Multiple police complaints were filed againstAllahabadiaandSamayRaina, who hosts the show‘India’sGotLatent‘.Both of them, along with some other participants on the show, were summoned by police for questioning and the issue was also raised inParliament. What was the joke about? On the show,Allahbadiaasked a contestant whether he would rather watch his parents have sex every day for the rest of his life or join in once and stop it forever. Allahbadia, who has interviewed senior Indian ministers andBollywoodcelebritieson hisYouTubechannel, has since apologised for the comments. Raina, meanwhile, has removed all videos of the show from hisYouTubechannel and said he was“fullycooperating”with the authorities. India’sSupreme Courton Tuesday shieldedAllahbadiafrom arrest but said his conduct showed“lackofresponsibility”and was “condemnable”. “There is something that is dirty in his mind that has been vomited by way of this programme,” the judge hearing the case said. The court also orderedAllahbadiato surrender his passport at a police station and barred him from leaving the country. The case, however, prompted a parliamentary panel to write to thecountry’sInformation Technology Ministry seeking steps to amend existing laws to clamp down on such content. Onelawmakeralso asked the Parliament to enact a law to regulate social media platforms, raising fears that the controversy will be used by the federal government to regulate online content. Concerns over freedom of speech Indian content creators onsocial media platformslike YouTube,Instagramand X are worried after the government last year proposed draft legislation that aims to overhaul and regulate broadcasting services in the country. The legislation, if enacted into law, would apply to all content creators including YouTubers. Manycontent creators,journalistsand digital experts say it could lead to censorship, stifle free speech and significantly expand thegovernment’spowers to regulate digital media content. “I think we are facing a threat that this particular incident might be a trigger point for obscenity laws,” saidNikhilPahwa, a digital policy analyst and founder of thetechwebsiteMediaNama. InAllahbadia’scase, observers say the controversy was blown out of proportion and could lead to a chilling effect onIndia’scomedy scene. “The morality of the audience and the current political atmosphere are very strong determining factors that decide whether our jokes are acceptable or not. And once a perception has been made about your content, no one can control its outcome. It is troubling,” saidAnuragMinus Verma, a cultural critic based in New Delhi. Indian comedians faced backlash in the past This is the not the first time Indian comedians have come under fire for their jokes and faced policecrackdownsor their shows being cancelled. Stand-up comedy has become hugely popular in recent years in India, but a swelling tide of nationalism underPrime MinisterNarendraModi’srule has also put comedians under scrutiny for making fun of politicians or making references to religion or national icons. In 2021, comedianVirDasfaced police complaints for his‘ICome from TwoIndias’show, which was critical of India over its fight against Covid-19, crimes against women andcrackdownson comedians. During his show,Dasdescribed India as a country where people“worshipwomen during the day but gang rape them at night”. That same year, comediansMunawarFaruquiandNalinYadavwere arrested by police for making allegedly objectionable remarks about Hindu deities while performing in an Indian Statethat’sruled byModi’sparty.Faruquiwas jailed for a month. © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT.

Why do we get sunburns even in snow?,https://telanganatoday.com/why-do-we-get-sunburns-even-in-snow,"When you're out in the snow, a lot of the solar radiation your skin receives is reflected from the snow itself  Hyderabad:It’s extremely easy to get sunburned while you’re skiing and snowboarding in the mountains, but have you ever wondered why? While it’s true when you’re high in the mountains, you’re slightly closer to the Sun, but that isn’t the reason. Being 1 mile higher up does mean the atmosphere is thinner, so there are fewer particles to block the ultraviolet radiation that causes sunburns. But the big reason your skin is more likely to burn has to do with all that fresh powder skiers and snowboarders crave, especially on perfect, blue-sky days. There are many ways that snow conditions affect how much your skin will burn. Fresh snow is very reflective When you’re out in the snow, a lot of the solar radiation your skin receives is reflected from the snow itself. The amount of radiation reflected is known as albedo. Fresh powder snow can have an albedo of almost 95%, meaning it reflects almost all of the Sun’s radiation that hits it. It’s much more reflective than older snow, which becomes less shiny. As snow ages, the snow crystal becomes more round and there are fewer surfaces to reflect light. Having lots of fresh snow increases albedo because the Sun penetrates into the powder, reflecting off the small, newly fallen crystals. Shallow snow is less reflective. A lot of people want to ski on what are known as bluebird days, when there is deep, fresh powder under a clear blue sky following a big snow dump. However, this provides the perfect conditions to burn from two directions: lots of Sun coming down from above and high albedo reflecting it back to your face from below. Clouds block sunlight, with only about one-third of the Sun’s radiation making it through a fully overcast sky. Which side of the mountain matters Where you are on the mountain also makes a difference. The slope and the direction that the slope faces, called aspect, also influences the intensity of the Sun on a surface. North-facing slopes in the Northern Hemisphere get less direct sunlight in the winter, when the Sun is farther south in the sky, so they stay cooler. A lot of the runs at Northern Hemisphere ski resorts face north, so the snow melts slower. The snow also varies from the top of the mountain to the base. There is more snow up high, and the snow melts slower there, so the albedo is higher at the top of the mountain than at the base. How to reduce the risk of sunburn To avoid sunburns, skiers and snowboarders need to take all of those characteristics into account. Because solar radiation is reflecting back up, people out in the snow should put sunscreen on the bottom of their noses, around their ears and on their chins, as well as the usual places. Most sunscreen also needs to be reapplied every two hours, particularly if you’re likely to sweat it off, wipe it off, or wear it off while playing on the slopes. However, surveys show that a few people remember to do this. Wearing clothing with UV protection to cover as much skin as possible can also help. These methods can help protect your skin from burning and the risks of cancer and premature aging that come with it. Snow lovers need to remember that they face higher sunburn risks on the slopes than they might be accustomed to. © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT.

Opinion: Language and War,https://telanganatoday.com/opinion-language-and-war,"By choosing specific terms such as ‘war’ and ‘conflict’, news narratives can shape public conscience, affirm governing measures and delineate global interactions  By Nigel George, Dr Karamala Areesh Kumar Conflict refers to any form of disagreement, opposition or clash which can be violent or non-violent. In contrast, war involves prolonged armed hostilities, typically between nations or factions, with a declared objective often political or territorial. It usually leads to significant destruction, loss of life and long-lasting consequences. While the two definitions look very similar to the innocent eye, a denotation of difference exists. Just a nominal glance shows that conflict has an element of non-violence that makes it seem more bearable than the concept of war. On that same note, we invite the reader to pay closer attention to the other words used in defining either of the concepts as the article zooms in on media representation and word usage of two global issues. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Palestine issues received the attention of the international community due to the involvement of superpowers, human rights violations, use of force and social media. In international affairs, language has an unmatched ability to sway public opinion and create global viewpoints. It becomes a force that may reveal or obfuscate the truth due to ideological prejudices through selected language and tales. The US Media US media houses frequently use “warfare” to describe Russian actions or “terror acts” for invasion, which could be seen as a conscious decision that incites anger and promotes an aggressive narrative. This further justifies heavy arms and resource support by framing Ukraine’s resistance as admirable. Even while using the word “war,” the US media depicts Russian military involvement by attaching more negatively loaded concepts, as illustrated in “Russia Escalates Attacks on Ukraine as Refugee…” or “The global impact of Russia’s war in Ukraine.” Such application implies hostility and illegitimacy, casting Russia as the infringer. However, there are notable linguistic shifts in the Israel-Palestine conflict. Despite claims of war crimes, these same publications frequently portray Israel’s actions as “defensive” and Palestinian casualties as a passive outcome of people who rather “die” than “are killed.” Israel’s actions are often then summed up as “skirmishes,” the sentiment visible in titles such as “Escalating violence between Israelis and Palestinians” or “Analysis: The latest violence between Israel and Iran”. This jargon suggests a more balanced contest between opposition parties, potentially breeding moral parity or compassion for Israel. A study by ‘The Intercept’ examined over 1,000 articles from major US newspapers and unearthed that the coverage was disproportionately highlighting Israeli perspectives and often underreported the impact on Palestinian civilians. The emotive language was usually deployed to describe Israeli casualties, whereas Palestinian deaths received comparatively muted attention. Such an imbalance could lead to a skewed public understanding of the situation, where Israel is portrayed as a victim and Palestinians as aggressors. This intentional linguistic framing manipulates public perception by dehumanising the opposing viewpoint and fostering empathy for the latter. The media takes advantage of this weakness in the general public’s lack of awareness by introducing ideas that selectively defend or denounce violence. Such reporting shapes how audiences worldwide see and respond to crises, creating a perceived reality rather than just providing information. Indian Media In India, international conflict news receives media coverage based on the nation’s diplomatic ties and domestic political dynamics. Media covering India’s developments considers the country’s friendship with other nations and what is happening politically within India. Traditionally, India has had close relationships with Russia since the Cold War. This naturally leads to Indian media taking a more subtle or even sympathetic approach when describing Russian military operations. For example, during the Russia-Ukraine crisis, Indian media emphasised Russia’s security interests and explained its behaviour as a reaction to NATO expansion. Despite claims of war crimes, US media frequently portrays Israel’s actions as ‘defensive’ and Palestinian casualties as a passive outcome of people who rather ‘die’ than ‘are killed’ In the case of Israel, India’s ties have changed considerably within the last several decades, with deepening political, military and economic connections seemingly seeping into the media coverage as well. The diplomatic nature of the emerging relationship frequently positively depicts Israel. News of Israeli military actions against Palestinian lands almost legitimises Israel’s right to self-defence, minimising the humanitarian effects on Palestinians. This kind of reporting seems to fall in line with the foreign policy of the current Indian government and its strategic interests in deepening relations with Israel. Impact of Political Allegiances In the US, cross-institutional cooperation by Israel affects the media to use sympathetic language toward Israeli interests. This can be seen in the hesitance to designate Israeli activities as “war crimes” or “aggression” when these words are more easily used to describe opposing countries like Russia. Likewise, in India, government strategic alliances shape media imagery, which results in reporting that advances national foreign policy interests. Media becomes a powerful force that reflects events and shapes societal beliefs and loyalties when language is used to persuade. Consequences of Linguistic Choices Using “conflict” and “disagreement” can affect people’s thoughts and how leaders talk about problems. Echoing Russia’s behaviour with “war” calls for ethical clarity. Alternatively, dubbing Israeli forces’ actions as “clashes” can incite a notion of a continuous, immutable issue that potentially leads to public indifference or acquiescence to the status quo. Moreover, the linguistic construction has implications for diplomacy and global responses. Some sovereign entities may be inclined to condemn or counter nations categorised as infringers within a “war,” while participants in “skirmishes” are urged to discuss and exercise temperance. The US and Indian media narratives on Russia-Israel affairs are intricately intertwined with partisan agendas and diplomatic objectives. By choosing specific terms such as “war” and “conflict”, news narratives can shape public conscience, affirm governing measures and delineate global interactions. Recognising this linguistic structuring is essential for a discerning interpretation of news narratives and a broader understanding of the media’s influence on international disputes.

Opinion: Key messages of World Day of Social Justice,https://telanganatoday.com/opinion-key-messages-of-world-day-of-social-justice,"A comprehensive framework that promotes inclusivity at all levels is a must for ensuring social justice  By Dr Shailesh February 20 is celebrated as the ‘World Day of Social Justice’. It was first observed in 2009 by the announcement of the UN General Assembly, 2007. The Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action (also called World Summit for Social Development, 1995) played a significant role in framing the World Day of Social Justice. The principal aim of the day is to keep the people at the core of social development. Social development itself ensures social justice, solidarity, harmony and equality within and among countries. Social justice,equalityand equity are the foundational values of every society. To achieve social justice, the government must establish a comprehensive framework that promotes inclusivity at all levels. Equitable job opportunities, income distribution and resource access through equity and equality were also promised to meet the objectives of Social Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. The theme of the World Day of Social Justice, 2025 is ‘Empowering Inclusion: Bridging Gaps for Social Justice,’ which highlights inclusive policies, lifelong learning and social safety nets as crucial tools to fight systemic inequality. The theme seems more significant for developing nations such as India and underdeveloped nations, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Cambodia. Problems in India India, besides being the most populous country in the world, is also known for its diversity. Caste, class, culture, gender, region, religion, colour and skin texture are the chief determinants of variation, including dress code and food flavours. Occasionally, these determinants look like barriers for the country whose one aim is justice as per the official gazette of the nation. The rural-urban diversity is very much common in India. There is a vast difference between them considering the geographical location and services in them. Being part of a neo-liberal world, the hard truth about the country is that a majority of the people still rely on agriculture for their livelihood. The high input cost of agriculture, climate change, low productivity and uncertainty in the prices of crops poseagrarian distress resulting in farmer suicides. The theme of the World Day of Social Justice, 2025, marked on Feb 20, is ‘Empowering Inclusion: Bridging Gaps for Social Justice,’ which highlights inclusive policies, lifelong learning and social safety nets as crucial tools to fight systemic inequality Approximately 87.5% of total suicides happen in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. The possibility of agrarian distress spreading quickly to other areas cannot be ruled out. Hence, considering the proportion of people engaged in agriculture, immediate intervention is mandatory. On the other hand, urban localities are crowded, which means the concentration of a large population in a small area. Overcrowded slums, pollution and health issues are prominent in urban areas. The Planning Commission reported that 22% of Indians were below the poverty line in 2012. Covid had a huge impact onpovertydue to the loss of employment opportunities in both rural and urban areas. Economic and social factors both contribute tounemployment. Unemployment indirectly provokes domestic violence that affects women. Today, wife battering, dowry deaths and sexual assaults are common in domestic violence. A significant portion of married Indianwomen, about 30%, are subjected to domestic violence. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) reported 4,45,256 cases under crimes against women in 2022 as against 4,28,278, in 2021. In this context, institutional involvement is crucial for mental well-being and opposing the oppression of half the population of the country. India has experienced ongoing tensions between Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs, but the legacy of the India-Pakistan partition has affected it negatively. India’s Constitution provides justice, tolerance, equality and freedom to protect Muslims, Sikhs and other religious minorities. Even with these provisions, India has experienced communal violence. Now India is seeing a fresh face of communal tension as mob lynching by some fringe groups. The governing institution attempts to overemphasise the importance of religious identity and this stimulates communal tension between different religious groups. As a result, constitutional institutions are reluctant to take action against culprits. Obstacles to Social Justice India faces structural, institutional, social and economic challenges in achieving social justice. The structural challenge is a traditional issue that has existed for decades. And deeply rooted caste hierarchies that perpetuateinequalityand discrimination govern it. The patriarchal nature of Indian society poses systemic oppression, violence and limited access to resources for women. Economic inequality widens the wealth gaps and poverty exacerbates social injustices. The institutional challenges involve bureaucracy and governing institutions at both local and national levels. Because of the inefficient judiciary, there are backlogged courts and lengthy trials. Both delay justice for marginalised communities. Further, corruption and nepotism in governance undermine effective governance and social welfare programmes. These are responsible for poverty and vulnerability in some sections of society. India also has a poor healthcare system. Again, the insufficient healthcare infrastructure and services, including corruption and nepotism in governance, disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. Social challenges underline communalism and xenophobia that involve intolerance and violence against minorities and marginalised groups — lack of education limits awareness of social justice issues.Economicchallenges associated with unemployment and underemployment exacerbate poverty and inequality. There is little social security in the neo-liberal world. Insufficient social security measures, including pensions and healthcare, for vulnerable populations make life harder. Lastly, India has the issues ofenvironmental degradationwhich disproportionately affect marginalised communities. India must adopt a holistic strategy, combining government action, community participation and individual commitment, to overcome these challenges and promote social justice and human rights to its citizens.

Opinion: Toxicity of body standards,https://telanganatoday.com/opinion-toxicity-of-body-standards,"When we let society dictate how we look, we lose control over our own lives  By Ankita Singh, Dr Moitrayee Das From fairness cream commercials to Bollywood’s obsession with slim figures, we’ve grown up in a world that defines ‘perfect’ in narrow, often unattainable ways. This fixation isn’t new; ancient texts often glorified physical beauty as a sign of virtue, and colonial influences equated fairness with power and privilege (Vijaya & Bhullar, 2022). In modern times, the media continues to amplify these rigid ideals and shape a society where appearance often overshadows individuality and self-worth. These standards aren’t just unrealistic; they’re damaging (Gelles, 2011). A recent Netflix documentary on Yo Yo Honey Singh, a name that transformed India’s music scene, sheds light on just how brutal these expectations can be. Honey Singh’s story is one that millions can relate to, even if they aren’t celebrities. At the peak of his career, he was loved by fans. But when he took a break due to mental health issues and gained weight from medication, everything changed. His fans began trolling him mercilessly. Social media was flooded with derogatory comments, mocking memes, and hashtags that questioned his relevance and talent. Instead of empathy, he was met with criticism and hate comments. This painful chapter of his life reveals the toxic relationship we have with body image. In this article, we will explore body image issues in India through the lens of Honey Singh’s journey as depicted in the Netflix documentary. Downfall of a StarThe documentary shows how Honey Singh struggled with bipolar disorder and alcoholism. “When I looked in the mirror, I didn’t see myself anymore,” he said in the film. He wasn’t just battling his mind; he was also fighting the world’s expectations. But perhaps the saddest part was his reaction. Instead of focusing on healing for himself, he decided to lose weight to please the public and look ‘acceptable’ again. While getting healthy is always good, the reason behind his decision makes it complicated. It is a multilayered complexity where the action of losing weight was positive, but the intention behind it was rooted in external pressure rather than self-motivation (Puhl & Suh, 2015). This reveals an important truth: sometimes, the right action can stem from a bad reason. Singh’s journey is a stark reminder of how deeply external judgment can shape personal choices. And that’s where the problem lies. When we let society dictate how we look, we lose control over our own lives. Trolling has real-world consequences. The constant barrage of negative comments can lead to isolation, self-esteem issues and even the worsening of existing mental health conditions. The documentary highlights how Singh’s once vibrant personality dimmed under the weight of public scrutiny. Trolling also reflects a deeper societal issue: the inability to empathise. Public figures are often seen as commodities rather than individuals with feelings. The dehumanisation of celebrities allows trolls to justify their cruel behaviour, forgetting that their words can have devastating effects (Karthika, 2022). Pressure to Be PerfectWhether it’s about being ‘fair and lovely’ or having the ‘perfect’ body, the standards are suffocating (Nagar, 2018). Think about the countless matrimonial ads that demand a ‘fair, slim bride’ or the constant comparison to Bollywood stars. It’s everywhere. India’s obsession with fairness traces back to colonial times when the British brought with them the idea that lighter skin meant power, sophistication and authority. Over time, this association was perpetuated through social hierarchies and economic opportunities that favoured those with fair skin. (Majidi, 2020). Losing weight to appease critics reflects the immense power societal pressure wields. Yo Yo Honey Singh’s journey is a stark reminder of how deeply external judgment can shape personal choices Even today, fairness creams are marketed as key to success. Advertisements tell us that being fair will get you the job, the spouse, and the respect you’ve always wanted. It’s a billion-dollar industry built on insecurities. In India itself, the size of the fairness products industry is around Rs 10,000 crore (Buch, 2020). The slimness craze, on the other hand, has been heavily influenced by Bollywood. Actresses are expected to maintain impossibly thin bodies, while actors who bulk up for roles are praised for their discipline (Ahmed, 2022). This creates a skewed standard, making it seem like being thin or muscular is the only way to be attractive. Role of Social MediaPlatforms like Instagram and TikTok are engineered to promote content that garners the most engagement. The algorithms prioritise posts featuring ‘ideal’ body types, reinforcing narrow beauty standards and making it even harder for people to embrace their natural selves (Franchina & Lo Coco, 2018). This toxic environment exacerbates body image issues not only for celebrities but for countless everyday users as well, making it crucial to hold these platforms accountable for the content they promote and the culture they foster. Filters erase imperfections, making it hard to tell what’s real and what’s not (Powell & Pring, 2023). For someone like Honey Singh, social media was both a gift and a curse. It gave him a platform to connect with fans, but it also became a space where he was relentlessly judged. Mental HealthA study focusing on young Indian men found that body image dissatisfaction is a prominent risk factor for conditions such as eating disorders, body dysmorphic disorder, depression, anxiety and substance use disorders (Sampath et al, 2020). Another study highlighted that Indian youth are more dissatisfied with their bodies now, which puts them at risk for disordered eating patterns (Singh & Gadiraju, 2020). These findings emphasise the urgent need to address body image issues as a public health concern in the country. Young people are particularly vulnerable. Schools often become breeding grounds for fat-shaming, with hurtful comments that leave lasting scars (Gam et al, 2020). Actions driven by internal goals, like improving health or self-confidence, tend to have a more lasting impact. However, when they are rooted in external validation, the benefits can feel hollow, and the individual may remain trapped in a cycle of self-doubt and people-pleasing. Honey Singh’s story is arealitycheck. It shows how damaging society’s obsession with looks can be and why we need to question these toxic standards. Instead of judging, we should choose empathy. Instead of chasing unrealistic ideals, we should celebrate diversity.

New Delhi:Amid a surge in digital payments where nearly four out of five payments in the country were conducted on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in FY24, UPI has emerged as the dominant force driving financial inclusion, merchant adoption and cross-border transactions. According to a new industry report,UPInow drives 84 per cent of all digital transactions in India. The report by fintech consulting and advisory firm The Digital Fifth, UPI represents more than just a payment system — it’s an entire financial ecosystem shaping India’s digital-first economy. “With UPI handling 16 billion transactions a month and projected to grow 3x by the end of 2030, the role of robust, high-resilience switching infrastructure becomes paramount,” according to Sameer Singh Jaini, Founder and CEO of The Digital Fifth. Real-time fraud detection, cloud-native architecture, and scalable, dual-core switches are no longer optional; they are essential to ensuring frictionless, secure, and fail-proof digital payments as India continues its journey toward a truly cashless, globally connected economy, he mentioned. UPI transactions surged 4 times from 2021 to 2024, reaching 172 billion transactions annually. It now dominates digital payments, far outpacing card-based and wallet transactions. With 30 million+ merchants onboarded on UPI, the merchant-to-consumer (P2M) segment is growing at 67 per cent on-year, outpacing peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions and signalling UPI’s transition into the primary retail payment system, the report mentioned. According to the RBI, digital payments across India recorded a double-digit jump of 11.1 per cent year-on-year (YoY) as on September 2024. According to the report, the share of the UPI in the country’s digital payments has surged from 34 per cent in 2019 to an impressive over 83 per cent in 2024, with a remarkable CAGR (cumulative average growth rate) of 74 per cent over the last five years. At a macro level, the volume of UPI transactions increased from 375 crore in 2018 to 17,221 crore in 2024, whereas the total value of transactions surged from Rs 5.86 lakh crore in 2018 to Rs 246.83 lakh crore in 2024. © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT.

Snow cover over Mount Everest continues to recede,https://telanganatoday.com/snow-cover-over-mount-everest-continues-to-recede,"Warmer and drier conditions have been prevailing in recent winters, including those of 2021, 2023, 2024 and 2025, which are driving a reduced snow cover, higher snow lines and increased forest fires, says expert  New Delhi:Snow cover atop Mount Everest retreated by 150 metres, indicating a lack of snow accumulation during the winter season of 2024-2025, researchers have noted. AnalysingNASAsatellite images from October 2023 till early January 2025, trends illustrated“arise in snow line through January in both 2024 and 2025″,glaciologistMauriPelto, a professor of environmental science atNicholsCollege, US, wrote in ablogpost on February 2. At 8,849 metres above sea level, Mount Everest is the tallest point on Earth. TheHimalayanpeak is located between Nepal and Tibet. ‘Snowline’refers to the boundary or elevation at which snow permanently stays on a mountain. A‘risingsnowline’— in which snow melts at lower heights, forcing the snow line boundary up a mountainside — is suggestive of a warming climate. Peltosaid that warmer and drier conditions have been prevailing in recent winters, including those of 2021, 2023, 2024 and 2025, which are driving a reduced snow cover, higher snow lines and increased forest fires. While the region saw a few small snow events early in each winter, the snow cover does not persist, suggesting that glaciers have continued to retreat even above 6000 metres on Mount Everest, he said. Snow cover loss during winter at these altitudes is primarily the result of sublimation — where ice directly evaporates — with losses observed up to 2.5 millimetres daily,Peltoadded. Sublimation is said to significantly contribute to the loss in overall mass of a glacier, causing it to retreat. In December 2024, Nepal saw 20-25 per cent of normal with drier conditions in the east, accompanied by above average temperatures. This resulted in extreme drought in several provinces, includingKoshiProvince, theglaciologistsaid. He observed that January 2025 has continued to be dry, with consistently warm conditions, thereby enabling high snow lines to persist and rise from early December into early February, 2025.“Theaverage snow line (on Mount Everest Region glaciers on January 28, 2025) is 6,100 metres — 150 metres higher than on December 11, 2024,”Peltowrote. Theblogpost was an update to that written in May 2024, which noted a“limitedsnowcover”persisting since November 2023. Theglaciologistexplained that the 2023-2024 winter season was “different”, because the high snow lines of 2020-21 were a result of an“extraordinaryJanuary heatwave”— there was no heat wave this time. Instead, above normal temperature and a“lackof any significantprecipitation”were critical to the outcome of rising snow line, with less than 25 millimetres of precipitation at Everest Base Camp during January 1 – March 31, 2024,Peltosaid. © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT.

"New bat Coronavirus HKU5-CoV-2 identified in China, potential risk of human transmission",https://telanganatoday.com/new-bat-coronavirus-hku5-cov-2-identified-in-china-potential-risk-of-human-transmission,"The South China Morning Post reported that researchers discovered HKU5-CoV-2 can attach to human ACE2 receptors, the same pathway utilized by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.  Beijing:A team of Chinese virologists has identified a new bat coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, that could potentially infect humans. Led by Shi Zhengli, a renowned scientist known as “Batwoman” for her extensive research on coronaviruses, the discovery raises concerns about the possibility of another zoonotic spillover. According to the South China Morning Post, researchers found that HKU5-CoV-2 can bind to human ACE2 receptors, the same entryway used by SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. This similarity suggests a potential risk of human transmission, though further research is needed to determine its real-world impact. HKU5-CoV-2 belongs to the merbecovirus subgenus, which includes the MERS-CoV virus that caused the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak. The study, cited by Newsweek, reveals that this new strain demonstrates a greater ability to adapt to human ACE2 receptors compared to other lineage 1 HKU5-CoVs. Laboratory tests confirmed that HKU5-CoV-2 successfully infected human cell cultures and mini-human organ models, reinforcing concerns about its zoonotic potential. The study highlights the high risk posed by bat merbecoviruses, which could jump to humans either directly or through intermediate hosts. However, researchers caution that more investigation is necessary to determine the likelihood of actual transmission and disease development in humans. While China has repeatedly denied theories linking COVID-19 to a lab leak, the Wuhan Institute of Virology remains at the centre of global scrutiny. The discovery of HKU5-CoV-2 further underscores the importance of monitoring bat coronaviruses and their potential risks to human health. At present, it remains unclear whether HKU5-CoV-2 poses an immediate health threat, but scientists emphasise the need for continued surveillance and preparedness to prevent future pandemics. © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT.

"Pentagon to cut 5,400 probationary workers starting next week",https://telanganatoday.com/pentagon-to-cut-5400-probationary-workers-starting-next-week,"It comes after staffers from the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, were at the Pentagon earlier in the week and received lists of such employees  Washington:The Defence Department has said that it’s cutting 5,400 probationary workers starting next week and will put a hiring freeze in place. It comes after staffers from the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, were at the Pentagon earlier in the week and received lists of such employees, US officials said on Friday. They said those lists did not include uniformed military personnel, who are exempt. Probationary employees are generally those on the job for less than a year and who have yet to gain civil service protection. “We anticipate reducing the Department’s civilian workforce by 5-8 per cent to produce efficiencies and refocus the Department on the President’s priorities and restoring readiness in the force,” Darin Selnick, who is acting undersecretary of defence for personnel and readiness, said in a statement. Probationary employees are generally those on the job for less than a year and who have yet to gain civil service protection. President Donald Trump’s administration is firing thousands of federal workers who have fewer civil service protections. For example, roughly 2,000 employees were cut from the US Forest Service, and an 7,000 people are expected to be let go at the Internal Revenue Service. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has supported cuts, posting on X last week that the Pentagon needs “to cut the fat (HQ) and grow the muscle (warfighters)”. The Defence Department is the largest government agency, with the Government Accountability Office finding in 2023 that it had more than 7,00,000 full-time civilian workers. Hegseth also has directed the military services to identify USD 50 billion in programs that could be cut next year to redirect those savings to fund Trump’s priorities. It represents about 8 per cent of the military’s budget. © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT. LTD. All rights reserved.

Washington: Kash Patel said on Friday that the American dream is alive as a “first generation Indian kid” is about to take charge of theFederal Bureau of Investigation(FBI). “I am living the American dream,” Patel said after taking the oath of office in the presence of his sister Nisha Patel, girlfriend Alexis Wilkins, and relatives. “Anyone that thinks the American Dream is dead, just look right here. You’re talking to a first-generation Indian kid who’s about to lead the law enforcement community, the greatest nation on God’s green earth.” Kashyap Pramod Vinod Pate 44, becomes the ninth Director of the FBI and the first of India and Asian descent. Patel’s parents are from Gujarat but came to the US from Canada after fleeing there from Uganda to escape ethnic repression. He grew up inNew York, went to study law, and became a public defender. His career has seen a meteoric rise, starting in President Trump’s first term, when he became the Chief of Staff at the Pentagon and Deputy Director of National Intelligence. Minutes before Patel received high praise from PresidentDonald Trump, who said, Patel “is going to go down as maybe the best ever” FBI Director. Patel has a polarising figure raising hackles on both sides of the aisle with sharp remarks and comments. Two Republican Senators voted along with all Democrats to oppose his confirmation in the vote that he won narrowly — 51-49 in the 100-member US Senate — on Thursday. President Trump acknowledged even he had thought his confirmation would be challenging because “he’s a tough guy, a strong guy (and) he has his opinions”. Speaking of his mission, Patel said, “100,000 people last year raped; 100,000 people died of CCP fentanyl (CCP is the Communist Party of China from where the drug starts the journey to the US) overdose and heroin; 17,000 homicides. Violent crime is out of control. We cannot have a United States of America where that is acceptable.” “Our national security mission is equally as important, he added: “Anyone that wishes to do harm to our way of life and our citizens here or abroad will face the full wrath of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. And if you seek to hide in any corner of this country or any corner of this planet, we will put on the world’s largest manhunt, and we will find you, and we will decide your end state, not you.” © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT.
