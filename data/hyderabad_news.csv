Unfortunately, our leaders were admitting that if there were any mistakes, they would be corrected. A few other leaders for gaining personal recognition, were stating that the figures were wrong and that the exercise should have been taken up in another way,” he said during a meeting with Congress BC leaders here on Saturday. “This was a long-pending demand and the Congress government is successfully taking it forward. You (BC leaders) might differ with me on other issues but support me in the caste survey exercise and own it up,” Revanth Reddy said. The Chief Minister said once the caste survey passes the judicial scrutiny, there would be demand for such surveys in other States as well. The Central government would be compelled to take up the survey, he said to the BC leaders. “If we forego this opportunity, it would be due to lack of political awareness. The benefits, including political, education, employment etc to be extended to sub castes would be discussed in the second phase. In the first phase, the focus was on determining the caste percentage and winning the people’s confidence,” he added.  © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT. LTD. All rights reserved.

History lives on in Hyderabad’s Bahrupiya Galli,https://telanganatoday.com/history-lives-on-in-hyderabads-bahrupiya-galli,"In the bustling neighbourhood of Puranapul, lies Bahrupiya Galli, but not many are aware of the name as they now call the area Chandrikapuram  Hyderabad:Neighbourhoods of Hyderabad, particularly the older parts of the city, have interesting tales to narrate. Several localities here draw their names from humans, animals, markets, communities and important buildings. In the bustling neighbourhood ofPuranapul, lies Bahrupiya Galli. Not many in the locality are aware of the name as they now call the place as Chandrikapuram, while some elderly know the name ‘Bahrupiya Galli’, but have no clear idea why it is called so. ‘Bahrupiya’ is a performer who impersonates characters from folklore, mythology and traditional stories. The word comes from the Sanskrit words ‘bahu’ (many) and ‘roop’ (form). In the municipal map of Puranapul — completed in 1913 after theMusi floodsunder the supervision of engineers Leonard Munn, AF Chinoy and AT Mackenzie — two lanes are marked as Bahrupiya Lane and Bahrupiya Kaccha Street. Around 200 houses were located in the lane. “In our property documents passed on to us by our forefathers, the name ‘Bahrupiya Lane’ is cited. Local residents don’t know why it is called so,” says V Kishore, a resident of the locality. During the Nizam era,Bahrupiyaor performers were recognised by the government for their skills. Many of them were great at mimicry and impersonation and would entertain in courts. Historian Karen Isaksen Leonard, in one of her writings, had mentioned: “Nizam’s Arbab-i-Nishat or Department of Entertainment included tawaifs, usually translated as courtesans or dancing and singing girls, qawwalayan (musicians), and bhands or bahrupiyas (mimics, buffoons).” They were looked after well by the administration. After the fall of theNizamgovernment, the Bahrupiya were reduced to street performers and, over a period of time, shifted to other towns and cities in the country. Local people point out that a second or third generation of the performers still live in the locality. “But they are no longer into the profession and don’t like themselves to be associated with it,” says another resident. A kilometre away from this place is Jauhari Galli atHussainialam, now popularly referred to as Koka Bazaar lane. Mohd Yousuf, an oldtimer says prominent jewellers of the city lived in the lane and hence it got the name Jauhari (jeweller). © Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT. LTD. All rights reserved.

This new system, which ends roll calls and marking attendance in registers, is aimed at monitoringstudents’attendance more effectively. Apart from monitoringstudents’turn up on a daily basis, parents will be informed about their wards absence from the college.“Ifa student is absent for four to five consecutive days, the college concerned will inform the parents.

The move by the department comes following a large absenteeism in thecolleges.
